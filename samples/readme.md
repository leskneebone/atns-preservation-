# ATNS RDF sample layout

These files and directories provide small modelling samples for public, non-deleted ATNS agreement records:

- `../model.ttl` defines conservative draft classes and properties for ATNS instance data.
- `../resources/catalogue.ttl` contains the sample `schema:DataCatalog` and dataset wrapper.
- `../resources/items/` contains individual resource item files split from the public agreement sample.
- `public-agreements.ttl` is the aggregate source sample used to derive the split resource files.

## Modelling notes

The sample keeps the original ATNS pattern of treating `Entity` as the central record. The ATNS entity category and subcategory values remain SKOS concepts from `vocabs/`, rather than being replaced by a new class hierarchy.

Use Schema.org and DCTERMS for stable publication-level meanings such as names, dates, locations, URLs, catalogue membership, citations and simple entity-to-reference links. Keep ATNS-specific terms for source-system semantics that need preservation, including source identifiers, ATNS categories/subcategories, deleted flags, relationship rows and controlled-list values. Do not replace an ATNS term with a broader external term unless the mapping is clear enough that source meaning is not lost.

Instance data uses IDN PID-style resource IRIs scoped under `https://data.idnau.org/pid/resource/atns/`. ATNS entity, reference, relationship-row and sample dataset IRIs are currently treated as preserved data resources, using bases such as `https://data.idnau.org/pid/resource/atns/entity/`, `https://data.idnau.org/pid/resource/atns/reference/`, `https://data.idnau.org/pid/resource/atns/entity-relationship/` and `https://data.idnau.org/pid/resource/atns/sample/`. IRI suffixes use deterministic UUIDs, such as `atns-entity:34524ede-2abc-50f1-af30-8493753c928e`, rather than source database identifiers. Do not duplicate these HTTP PID IRIs as `schema:identifier` nodes.

Legacy ATNS identifiers are preserved separately as source-system values. For example, the public EID `A003259` is recorded with `atns:eid "A003259"^^xsd:token`, the source `Entities.EntityID` value `24` is recorded with `atns:sourceEntityId 24`, source `Refs.RefID` values are recorded with `atns:sourceReferenceId`, and source `Entity_Entity.Entity_EntityID` values are recorded with `atns:sourceRelationshipId`. Use `schema:identifier "..."^^xsd:token` only if a later sample needs a non-HTTP catalogue identifier that is not already covered by one of these preservation properties. The `https://data.idnau.org/pid/org/` and `https://data.idnau.org/pid/person/` bases are reserved for later first-class organisation and person identifiers, rather than being used for every legacy ATNS entity row that happens to describe an organisation or person.

The split resource item filenames are convenience locators, not RDF identifiers. Entity files use the source `Entities.EntityID` value, such as `../resources/items/atns-24.ttl`. Reference files use `atns-ref-<sourceReferenceId>.ttl`, and relationship-row files use `atns-rel-<sourceRelationshipId>.ttl`, so the different source ID spaces cannot collide in filenames.

Agreement-like distinctions such as framework agreement, funding agreement, ILUA, treaty, deed of settlement and settlement agreement appear in the source as subcategories. For now the sample models those as `atns:subcategory` links. This avoids prematurely deciding whether they are separate RDF classes, legal-document genres, negotiated-process types, or public-display facets.

Entity-to-entity relationships are represented as relationship nodes. This preserves the source `Entity_EntityID`, the subject entity, the object entity and the ATNS relationship-type concept. It also leaves room to attach provenance or confidence later.

Entity-to-reference links use `dcterms:references` in the simple sample when the only required assertion is that an entity references a source. The ATNS source also records reference-link roles such as `Primary`; model `Entity_Refs` rows as qualified relationship nodes when the row identity, role, provenance, ordering or uncertainty needs to be preserved. In that qualified form, keep a direct `dcterms:references` triple as a convenience assertion only if it does not contradict the qualified node.

## Sensitivity note

The sample intentionally uses public, non-deleted entity and reference rows only. It does not include attachment/document binaries or raw legal documents, because project context indicates some source materials may have been internal-only and not intended for public release.
